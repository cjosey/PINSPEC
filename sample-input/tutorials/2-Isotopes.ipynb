If the data for an Isotope you wish to use is not included in the library, you may add it to the library according to the instructions in the PINSPEC documentation <a href=\"https://github.com/mit-crpg/PINSPEC/wiki/Isotopes#wiki-adding-new-isotopes-to-the-library\" target=\"None\">here</a>.<br/> <br/>**NOTE:** You will only be able to add new Isotopes to your own local copy of PINSPEC.
